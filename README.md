## 📖 **Project Overview**

*"A Tale of Two Buttons: Ramen Dreams on a Budget"* is an interactive web application designed to offer a fun and creative way to explore the emotional connections we have with food, particularly ramen. The game challenges players to create a personalized ramen bowl using two simple buttons, each representing a choice with unique consequences. The twist? Players must manage their budget while making these decisions, adding an element of strategy and realism to the experience.

This project was developed as part of the **CPSC 581 Human-Computer Interaction II (Fall 2024)** course, with a focus on imaginative and user-friendly design, and a unique gameplay experience that tells an inspiring story with just two buttons.

## 🌟 **Project Story**

As a passionate food lover, Hima has always enjoyed exploring new cuisines, and ramen holds a special place in her heart. What started as a quick and easy meal evolved into a deeper cultural experience for Hima and her friends. It became the go-to dish for celebrating small victories and navigating tough times together.

The idea of ramen has also been tied to her experiences with budgeting. In high school, Hima and her friends often couldn’t afford the extra toppings they craved. This struggle, coupled with their love for ramen, inspired the inclusion of a budget meter in this project. The budget simulates the real-life challenge of making choices based on financial constraints, creating an emotional connection to the ramen creation process.

## 🎮 **How to Use the Application**

1. **Start the Game** 🎲
   Upon loading the application, you’ll be greeted by a ramen bowl ready to be customized.

2. **Choose Toppings** 🍥🥚
   You’ll have **three opportunities** to add toppings to your ramen.

   * For each topping, you will choose between two buttons:

     * **Good Topping** ✅: Adds a traditional, flavorful ramen topping.
     * **Bad Topping** ❌: Adds an unconventional, possibly disastrous topping.

3. **Making Selections** 👆

   * Each topping has a price and impacts the **happiness score**:

     * **Good Toppings** boost happiness 😊 (+1).
     * **Bad Toppings** lower happiness 😕 (-1).
   * **Budgeting Challenge:** Hima has a budget of \$10.00. If she exceeds her budget, she'll fall into debt, reducing her happiness by **10 points for each topping** beyond the budget limit. For example, adding a topping that pushes the budget below \$0.00 decreases happiness by 10, and further toppings will continue to have this effect.

4. **Track Your Progress** 📊

   * The **Topping #** counter shows your current topping selection out of 3.
   * The **Happiness** score reflects your overall ramen satisfaction, with an emoji indicating mood.

5. **Completion** 🎉

   * Once you’ve selected all 3 toppings, the game concludes.
   * A **Happy** animation plays if the happiness score is positive. 😄
   * A **Sad** animation plays if the happiness score is negative. 😢
   * The final ramen bowl, along with your toppings, will resize and reposition to reveal the result of your choices.

6. **Restart or Quit** 🔄🚪

   * **Remake Ramen!** 🍲: Reset the game and try a new ramen bowl.
   * **Quit** ❎: Exit the application.
